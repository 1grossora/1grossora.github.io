	  <p>I'm a 29 year old with a Ph.D in particle physics from the University of Cincinnati currently living in Chicago.</p>
          <p>I am interested in applying data science skills that I have picked up through my career and apply them to real world problems that positivly impact companies, social interaction, and the world. </p>
	  <p>I am also very passionate about STEM outreach and giving back to the community. I volunteer as speaker at the <a href="http://www.adlerplanetarium.org"> Adler Planetarium</a> and frequenlty get involved in tech meetups around the city. </p>

    <p> Other interests of mine include travel, photography, riddles, and sleep.</p>

      <p> My Thesis was done with the MicroBooNE detector at Fermi Nation Accelerator Lab (FNAL) in Batavia, Il. The detector is large Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) which is to study the properties of neutrinos, a fundamental particle of nature. I joined the collaboration begining of the construction phase and was lucky to play an integral role assebling the primary system of the detector.</p> 
    <p> Being able to contrubite to both construction, commisioning, and data analysis is something most graduate student unfortunatly do not get to do anymore. Below shows a video of cosmic ray particles that are reconstruced with our detector.</p> 
   <p> Check back and a personal link to learn more about MicroBooNE will be finished soon. For now, more information can be found at <a href="https://www-microboone.fnal.gov/"> MicroBooNE's website</a>
