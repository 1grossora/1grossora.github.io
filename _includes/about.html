	  <p>I'm a 29 year old with a Ph.D in particle physics from the University of Cincinnati currently living in Chicago.</p>
          <p>I am interested in applying data science skills that I have picked up through my career and apply them to real world problems that positively impact companies, social interaction, and the world. </p>
	  <p>I am also very passionate about STEM outreach and giving back to the community. I volunteer as speaker at the <a href="http://www.adlerplanetarium.org"> Adler Planetarium</a> and frequently get involved in tech meet-ups around the city. </p>

    <p> Other interests include travel, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/groryangro/?hl=en">photography </a>, riddles, and <a href="https://www.sadtrombone.com/?autoplay=true">sleep</a>. </p>

      <p> My Thesis was done with the MicroBooNE detector at Fermi National Accelerator Lab (<a href="http://www.fnal.gov/">FNAL</a>) in Batavia, Il. The detector is large Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) which is to study the properties of neutrinos, a fundamental particle of nature. I joined the collaboration at the beginning of the construction phase and was lucky to play an integral role assembling the primary system of the detector.</p> 
    <p> Being able to contribute to both construction, commissioning, and data analysis is something most graduate student unfortunately do not get to do anymore. Below shows a video of cosmic ray particles that are reconstructed with our detector.</p> 
   <p> Check back soon, personal link to learn more about MicroBooNE will be available. For now, more information can be found at <a href="https://www-microboone.fnal.gov/" target="_blank"> MicroBooNE's website</a>
