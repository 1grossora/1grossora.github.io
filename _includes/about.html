	  <p>I am 29 years old with a Ph.D in particle physics from the University of Cincinnati currently living in Manhattan as an Insight data science fellow. </p>
          <p>I spent the majority of my graduate career stationed at Fermilab National Accelerator Lab(FNAL) in the Chicago area. I am interested in applying data science skills that I have picked up through my career and apply them to real world problems that positively impact companies, social interaction, and the world. </p>
	  <p>I am also very passionate about STEM outreach and giving back to the community. I have volunteered as speaker at theÂ <a href="http://www.adlerplanetarium.org"target="_blank"> Adler Planetarium</a> and Cincinnati Observatory and frequently get involved in tech or data science meet-ups. I am always looking for more networks to connect (especially now in NYC) feel free to contact me if are looking for a speaker or someone to grow your numbers. </p>

    <p> I also enjoy keeping an internet presence and enjoy frequenting sites such as <a href="http://www.datatau.com/"target=_blank"> DataTau</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/"target=_blank"> HackerNews</a>, and <a href="https://www.quora.com/"target=_blank"> Quora</a>. Other interests include travel, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/groryangro/?hl=en"target="_blank">photography </a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9nzjxvGglKUeGZ4LVFJX2E5d3M/view?usp=sharing"target="_blank">playing piano</a>, riddles, and <a href="https://www.sadtrombone.com/?autoplay=true"target="_blank">sleep</a>. </p>

      <p> My Thesis was done with the MicroBooNE detector at Fermi National Accelerator Lab (<a href="http://www.fnal.gov/" target="_blank">FNAL</a>) in Batavia, Il. The detector is large Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) which is to study the properties of neutrinos, a fundamental particle of nature. I joined the collaboration at the beginning of the construction phase and was lucky to play an integral role in assembling the primary TPC system of the detector.</p> 
    <p> Being able to contribute to both construction, commissioning, and data analysis is something most graduate student unfortunately do not get to do anymore. Below shows a video of cosmic ray particles that are reconstructed with our detector.</p> 
   <p> Check back soon, personal link to learn more about MicroBooNE will be available. For now, more information can be found at <a href="https://www-microboone.fnal.gov/" target="_blank"> MicroBooNE's website</a>
